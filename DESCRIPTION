There are lots of MPPT algorithms described in literature. But they can hardly be implemented in tracking the curve with multiple maximums. Multiple maximums appear in series connections of the PV modules, equipped with bypass diodes, under non-uniform conditions or with variation of internal parameters of PV modules. Thus, the main goal is to develop the application for simulation V-I and V-P characteristics of PV Power Plant of different configuration and with different partial shading cases.
Firstly, part of typical PV Power Plant configuration has been considered. The experiment has been carried out with this part, which consists of 3 parallel strings of 2 PV modules connected in series and equipped with bypass diodes on each. Research facilities consist of ammeter, voltmeter and rheostat with variable active resistance. 
The non-uniform conditions are reproduced by shading PV modules in different combinations. V-I characteristics of PV array are obtained by adjusting the load resistance. In the cases, when one of two series PV modules are shaded, we obtain the curve with two “necks” in contrast to uniform insu(o)lation in series connection. 
As a result, the power curves can be obtained after calculations. So, in this case, we have multiple maximums on V-P characteristics of (the) part of PV Power Plant.
Secondly, we present the equivalent scheme of PV module with bypass diode on the modeling stage. It consists of ideal current source, semiconductor p-n transition diode, shunting resistance and series resistance of wires. The bypass diode is connected anti-parallel to the p-n transition diode. In order to simulate the V-I characteristics load resistance is connected to the module. We propose Math model of PV module. The algorithm of V-I characteristics calculation program has been developed on its basis. We also propose the model of PV Power Plant configuration.
Finally, in C++ Builder programming environment the model of PV Power Plant has been calculated and graphical user interface has been created. In the main window of the application user can adjust external conditions (temperature, insolation), degree of shading, PV Power Plant configuration with distribution of shading via the network of the PV modules. V-I and V-P characteristics are presented in the main window of this application.
